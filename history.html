            <li>My whole programming history started when i was 8. I used to always wonder how do apps, sites, computers work... After some time my mother has offered me to start coding with one book about Scratch. Scratch was the first programming language I was learning. I worked with Scratch for 4 years. I also went to loads of circles like "Bit&Byte", "CodeAcademyKids", "Smarttech". In these circles my teachers showed me more programaming languages, showed me what is computer engineering and more. And after all those 5 years of me being interested in programming, I am going to continue learning programming languages like: HTML & CSS, Python, Scratch, JavaScript, Lua... Coding has turned into a really important part in my life and I am hoping to become a WEB developer when I'll grow up. </li>

            <li>In 2021-2022 I finished Python basic course in "SmartTech" with a 10 marks.</li>
